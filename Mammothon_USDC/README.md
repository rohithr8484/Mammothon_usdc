# üèó IdeaBox (WIP)

A platform for creators to sell digital content and subscription services payment via USDC and Credit Card, built on [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test Mode Instructions**
>
> ```
> Currently the app is in test mode, so you can test the USDC payment as well as the Card payment method:
>
> 1. For Crypto Payment: (only on local network)
>    - Use the faucet to get some ETH
>    - The payment will be successful but will send test ETH
>    - ETH will be transferred on Localhost instead of USDC on live chain
>
> 2. For Credit Card Payment: (works on live demo)
>    - Test Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
>    - CVC: Any 3 digits
>    - Expiry Date: Any future date
>
> 3. Development Environment:
>    - All features run on localhost for testing
>    - Free tier available for all integrations (Privy, Stripe, Upstash)
>    - Perfect for testing product demand before upgrading to paid tiers
> ```
