🏗 IdeaBox (WIP)
A platform designed for creators to monetize digital content and subscription services with payments via USDC and credit cards. Built on Scaffold-ETH 2.

⚠️ Test Mode Guidelines

The application is currently in test mode, allowing you to try out USDC and credit card payments:
 
1. **Crypto Payments (Local Network Only)**  
   - Use the faucet to obtain ETH  
   - Transactions will process successfully but will send test ETH  
   - Payments occur on Localhost instead of USDC on the live blockchain  
 
2. **Credit Card Payments (Live Demo Available)**  
   - Test card details: 4242 4242 4242 4242  
   - CVC: Any three digits  
   - Expiry: Any future date  
 
3. **Development Environment**  
   - Features operate locally for testing  
   - Free-tier support for integrations (Privy, Stripe, Upstash)  
   - Ideal for testing market demand before upgrading to paid plans
